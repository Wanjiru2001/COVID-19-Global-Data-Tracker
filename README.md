Data Source
This application uses data from Our World in Data COVID-19 dataset, which compiles data from various official sources including the WHO, Johns Hopkins University, and government health ministries.
The dataset includes:

Daily and cumulative confirmed COVID-19 cases
Daily and cumulative confirmed COVID-19 deaths
Hospitalizations and intensive care unit (ICU) admissions
Testing data
Vaccination data

Technical Details
Architecture
The application is built with:

Streamlit: Web application framework
Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
Plotly: Interactive visualizations
Matplotlib/Seaborn: Additional visualization capabilities

Performance Optimization

Data caching to minimize repeated downloads
Efficient filtering and processing of large datasets
Progressive loading of visualizations

Error Handling
The application includes comprehensive error handling to:

Gracefully handle data source unavailability
Provide meaningful feedback when data is missing
Offer alternative visualizations when primary options aren't available

Troubleshooting
Common Issues
Data not loading:

Check your internet connection
Verify the data source is accessible
Use the "Force Refresh Data" button in the sidebar

Slow performance:

Reduce the date range being analyzed
Select fewer countries for comparison
Check your system resources

Visualization errors:

Make sure you've selected countries with available data
Some metrics may not be available for all countries
Try refreshing the application

Debug Information
The sidebar includes a "Debug Info" section that provides:

Application version
Python and package versions
Data loading time and memory usage
Missing value information

Future Enhancements
Planned features for future versions:
